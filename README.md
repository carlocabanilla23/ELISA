# ELISA - ECS Lab Inventory System App

ELISA is a user-friendly lab inventory management system designed for the Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) lab at Seattle Pacific University. As a senior capstone project, our team of five collaborated closely with our client to create a seamless and efficient inventory management experience, delivering the MVP weeks ahead of schedule.

## Overview

Our client, the ECS lab inventory manager, was struggling to keep track of the inventory and manage equipment reservations by students. ELISA was developed to address these pain points and provide an efficient, comprehensive system for managing the lab's inventory.

The main goal of ELISA is to streamline the reservation process for students and equip the inventory manager with powerful tools to monitor and manage the lab's inventory in real-time. The MVP includes core features such as reservation capabilities, QR code generation, inventory reporting, equipment updates, visualizations, and notifications.

## Core Features

- **Reservation feature**: Students can reserve equipment for their projects, eliminating the need for manual coordination.
- **Generating QR codes and barcodes**: Inventory managers can quickly generate QR codes and barcodes for each equipment, simplifying tracking and management.
- **Inventory reporting**: ELISA provides real-time data on inventory levels, enabling informed decision-making regarding orders and replacements.
- **Updating equipment information**: Inventory managers can effortlessly update the quantity, status, and information for each equipment, ensuring accurate records.
- **Visualization and summaries**: ELISA offers visual representations of data, making it easy to identify trends and patterns.
- **Notifications**: The system sends notifications to students and inventory managers about equipment status, reservation availability, and low inventory levels.
- **Mobile**: ELISA has the mobile layout to ensure users can easily interact with the app on their smartphones

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:::

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`


Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
1It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Future Enhancements
As ELISA continues to evolve, we plan to implement advanced features such as:

- Self-checkout system
- Automated reminders

These enhancements will further improve the user experience and solidify ELISA as the go-to solution for lab inventory management.

## Acknowledgments
Our team would like to express our gratitude to our client and the faculty at Seattle Pacific University for their guidance and support throughout the project. We are proud to have delivered a valuable solution for the ECS lab and look forward to ELISA's ongoing success.
