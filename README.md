# ELISA - ECS Lab Inventory System App

ELISA is a user-friendly lab inventory management system designed for the Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) lab at Seattle Pacific University. As a senior capstone project, our team of five collaborated closely with our client to create a seamless and efficient inventory management experience, delivering the MVP weeks ahead of schedule.

## Overview

Our client, the ECS lab inventory manager, was struggling to keep track of the inventory and manage equipment reservations by students. ELISA was developed to address these pain points and provide an efficient, comprehensive system for managing the lab's inventory.

The main goal of ELISA is to streamline the reservation process for students and equip the inventory manager with powerful tools to monitor and manage the lab's inventory in real-time. The MVP includes core features such as reservation capabilities, QR code generation, inventory reporting, equipment updates, visualizations, and notifications.

## Core Features

- **Reservation feature**: Students can reserve equipment for their projects, eliminating the need for manual coordination.
- **Generating QR codes and barcodes**: Inventory managers can quickly generate QR codes and barcodes for each equipment, simplifying tracking and management.
- **Inventory reporting**: ELISA provides real-time data on inventory levels, enabling informed decision-making regarding orders and replacements.
- **Updating equipment information**: Inventory managers can effortlessly update the quantity, status, and information for each equipment, ensuring accurate records.
- **Visualization and summaries**: ELISA offers visual representations of data, making it easy to identify trends and patterns.
- **Notifications**: The system sends notifications to students and inventory managers about equipment status, reservation availability, and low inventory levels.
- **Mobile**: ELISA has the mobile layout to ensure users can easily interact with the app on their smartphones

## Future Enhancements
As ELISA continues to evolve, we plan to implement advanced features such as:

- Self-checkout system
- Automated reminders

These enhancements will further improve the user experience and solidify ELISA as the go-to solution for lab inventory management.

## Acknowledgments
